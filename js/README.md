Developement guide:

    First, make sure that you have [`git`](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer. Create your own [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of the repository, then clone it to your computer:

    git clone git@github.com:[YOUR GITHUB NAME]/expungement-dc.git

	You can work on the `master` branch (which is the default), but it's preferable to set up a new branch if you're working on a specific feature:
